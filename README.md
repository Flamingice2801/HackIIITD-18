## HumaneBlock - A BlockChain based identity verification system for refugees

Provides an interface for safe, secure and fast identity management system for displaced refugees.

Applications like these are especially important today due to the large number of refugees displaced from their homelands. 

A dashboard is also provided in the web app which reduces the middlemen in transactions between the government and the people.

Due to the implementation of blockchain in the backend, this app proves to be safe and secure as the identities of refugees cannot be tampered or changed once recorded.
